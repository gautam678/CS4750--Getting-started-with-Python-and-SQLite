* Using Google Maps API, get latitude and longitude of locations and push it to the database.


## Required Softwares & Packages
* [SQLite browser](http://sqlitebrowser.org/)

## Running the code

* Create a text file in the working directory called 'where.txt'. This would contain the name of the locations we would
  want to mark in map.

* Run geodump.py, this reads from the sqlite database created and pulls data
* Open where.html to see locations you specified on where.txt marked on the map.
